Problems we face 

A escrow without good governance 
A smart contract without codes
Inability for innovators to test run ideas without going through complexity 
Expensive trading fees
Inability to have trusted oracle world wide data store without complexities of codes 
A bad industry for eCommerce
A closed source bank for Fiat data 

How we solve all this is listed in our LightPaper


The Data and Barcode Oracle Protocol 

WHAT WE NEED IS A TRADER FX PROTOCOL

A protocol is an implementation of Blockchain Technology, e.g BTC, ETH, EOS and more, a system of rules, features like http for internet etc, like bittorrent is a protocol.
TraderFX is a protocol designed to create a decentralized oracle network of trading contracts that can interact together from various chains, this would be built into the functioning of the protocol that would determine everything from stable coin rebase activity and also DeFi 

TRADERFXM is a centralised n decentralized marketplace for buying and selling crypto’s of all ramifications, crypto related assets n wallet for payments innovating the Finance and Commerce Industry .


Proof of Concept

Can banks be open source cause if they are then we can collect data from them through API, traversing info for several purpose.

So our escrow API collects data that it uses to track transactions for on-chain records.

Thereafter for off chain records we setup a barcode system that records ownership of items the chain cannot track eg ‘a car that has a unique product barcode can get its recorded data generated by a data minting which adds data to the chain. This enables clearance in ownership and could aid a good exchange in deals. The data minting process would be easy to use by even newbies in the tech space.

As a data minting company we collect large scale data from as much data minters as possible by so doing we serve as an Oracle

 If these data of products can be appropriately recorded then transactions with them can be fluent, easily monitored, have good utility to individual, industries and trusted by its truth. 



GOAL
TraderFX seeks to create widespread exposure of decentralization to the world economy also giving the opportunity for innovators to setup good ideas today to create strong liquid access to financial instruments 


CEX MARKETPLACE

Why do we need a CEX? Well for extra data, a banking system and a 


P2P
We come up with an upgraded centralized p2p where we integrate any payment gateway as payment method similar to what every other p2p has but competitive by fee reduction 
Also we create a TraderFX merchant store to buy and sell big volume assets that connects with our escrow API,  this would be on TFXM
Next we enable several crypto integrations to give access to a larger p2p due to this possibility of running on a centralized cloud server wouldn’t be good unless we have a big data storage capacity hence we would transfer hosting to a decentralized server 

EXCHANGE AND SWAP 
Direct swap gateway: we integrate a bank’s oracle or we create our own open source fiat financial system by having a license to operate as a bank to enable fiat swap. 




  USERS







DEX MARKETPLACE

Why do we need a DEX? A wallet connector, LP, payment integrations, a zero code escrow for user to create contract they can experiment or make use of for several activities 

Mimicking of some crypto projects would enable this here is a list we’d take into consideration ‘Nimiq, Kleros, Ampleforth, Mirror Protocol, Nexo (also some other lending/borrowing protocol).

P2P and SWAP

Nimiq outlook provides the main concept of collateralization, in this process an intending DEX P2P user is required to collateralize any product he/she wishes to sell in the escrow. Before this is done there’d be a clause written by the seller such that when a buyer sees he makes decision to execute with the feeling of certainty, this clause can be negotiable so as to give opportunity for bidding and any other reason for it. As for the buyer before he is eligible to trade with the seller he is required to fulfill his end of the bargain which could possibly warrant him to make a choice of collaterizing his or her product, now the idea of collateralizing is for the run of a proper decentralized system of escrow n here is why.
	• Gas/Escrow Fund Fee
	• User Protection
	• And a Decentralized Jury
	
I’m sure from the outline you are stunned and curious especially about the ‘Decentralized Jury’ now here’s where Kleros comes in the concept of ‘Kleros’ with its native token PNK came from the idea of  ‘game theory’ and this concept can enable a fair/truthful p2p 

Now Ampleforth, Mirror and Nexo are all DeFi protocols that enable either derivatives, borrowing, lending and farming as well as swapping these project concepts would be implemented in the TraderFX code to establish several financial activities as a DeFi protocol.
